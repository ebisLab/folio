        content:
          "The whole week was rather stressfull. I spent more time outside of class time trying to debug the code that I couldnt finish each class time. I realized that I was frustrating my team members with all my questions. But I was ademant that this was going to be THE project that we would at least not feel embarassed to put in our portfolio. With useState and hooks I was able to create the dashboard to house and render the data received from the backends API. The first couple of days to make it alot easier for all of us and to envision what the site would look like, I used the Random User API. I made several API requests, after learning that I was making things even more complicated by using one parent component and passing down the props into the child component. The React II guy set up the routes and private routes, but I had to continue to rely on the 3rd party API because the third React guy spent 2 days building a login form that we would need to retrieve the token to house into our localstorage. (🤷). As annoying as that was, I learned how to use Postman to access the backend's data after everything on their end was finally published, and I needed to store the token generated from logging in, via postman, in the application tab on dev console on Chrome. Not going to lie, I felt alot better knowing what I know now. That's why I felt compassion for the third React guy, probably he felt the way I felt the first time around, but to be honest, I feel he could have done alot more other than styling the login and registration form ... ALL WEEK, but I digress... The issue we were still having was coming up with a state management system to centralize everything that both we React I would find easy to grasp, but it didn't come in time. My search filtering function wasn't rendering on the onChange. It works, don't get me wrong, just had to click the tab again to get it to filter. After a while we made the decision to scrap it (2 days gone down the drain 😭) from our final draft. React II guy went back and attempted to centralize everything via Context API, because to reach MVP we needed a way to scan and generate a QR code (it keeps haunting me). This meant that he had to go back and refactor my entire code, so now I'm looking at my own code and it looks like a completely foreign code to me. I suddenly remember the power of comments. I wished I reminded the React I guy to comment his stuff so that the React II guy would find iind it easier to understand, since React II guy didnt work with Formik and Yup for validation. I did 'some' commenting but not enough because my anxiety kept forcing me to make things clean. What I learned from this whole experience was to always comment my code even if I havent finished it, and to remove unnecessary code. I have the fear of deleting old functional code to make way for new experimental code. I'm working on it. I also need to work on making my code cleaner. When I begin writing code, I tend to put them all in one component. An advice I received from my React II person was to do everything one component at a time, so if a problem arises, it'll be easier for me to isolate the issue. I'll be sure to do that."
